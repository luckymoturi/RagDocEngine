    "response": "The provided document excerpts cover key concepts related to educational philosophy, modern farming methods, and the concept of the poverty line in India. These sections appear to be from an educational textbook, likely for students of economics and social sciences.\n\nHere's an explanation of the main themes presented:\n\n### 1. Educational Philosophy and Curriculum Development\n\nThe **FOREWORD** section outlines the guiding principles behind the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 and its implementation in syllabi and textbooks, specifically by the National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT).\n\n*   **Linking School Life to Outside Life**: A core recommendation of NCF 2005 is to connect children's learning experiences in school with their lives outside of it. This marks a significant shift from traditional \"bookish learning\" that often creates a disconnect between school, home, and community.\n*   **Discouraging Rote Learning**: The framework aims to move away from memorization without understanding. Instead, it promotes deeper engagement with learning material.\n*   **Breaking Subject Boundaries**: The NCF discourages rigid divisions between different subject areas, encouraging a more integrated approach to knowledge.\n*   **Child-Centred Education**: The goal is to evolve towards a system where the child is at the center of the learning process, as outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986). This involves treating children as active participants in learning, capable of generating new knowledge when given \"space, time and freedom.\"\n*   **Fostering Creativity and Initiative**: The document emphasizes that creativity and initiative can be nurtured if children are seen as active learners, rather than just passive \"receivers of a fixed body of knowledge.\"\n*   **Changes in School Routines and Teaching Methods**:\n    *   **Flexibility**: Calls for flexibility in daily timetables while maintaining rigor in the annual calendar to ensure sufficient teaching days.\n    *   **Effective Evaluation**: The methods used for teaching and evaluation are crucial to making school a \"happy experience\" rather than a source of stress or boredom.\n    *   **Reducing Curricular Burden**: Syllabus designers have attempted to lighten the burden by restructuring knowledge with consideration for child psychology and available teaching time.\n    *   **Active Learning**: Textbooks are designed to encourage contemplation, wondering, small group discussions, and hands-on experiences.\n*   **Role of Textbooks and Examinations**: The document notes that treating the prescribed textbook as the *sole* basis for examination often leads to the neglect of other valuable learning resources and sites.\n\n### 2. Modern Farming Methods and the Green Revolution\n\nThis section from \"Economics\" discusses strategies for increasing agricultural production, particularly focusing on the shift from traditional to modern farming practices in India.\n\n*   **Ways to Increase Production**:\n    1.  **Multiple Cropping**: Growing more than one crop on the same piece of land during a single season.\n    2.  **Modern Farming Methods**: Employing advanced techniques and inputs to achieve higher yields.\n*   **Yield**: Defined as the amount of crop produced on a given piece of land during a single season.\n*   **Traditional Farming (pre-1960s)**:\n    *   **Seeds**: Used traditional seeds which had relatively low yields.\n    *   **Irrigation**: Required less irrigation.\n    *   **Fertilizers**: Farmers used natural manures like cow-dung, which were readily available and did not need to be purchased.\n*   **The Green Revolution (late 1960s)**:\n    *   **Introduction**: This period marked a significant transformation in Indian agriculture with the introduction of High Yielding Varieties (HYVs) of seeds, primarily for wheat and rice.\n    *   **Impact of HYV Seeds**: These seeds promised to produce \"much greater amounts of grain on a single plant,\" leading to \"far larger quantities of foodgrains\" from the same land compared to traditional methods.\n    *   **Requirements**: However, HYV seeds were demanding, requiring \"plenty of water and also chemical fertilizers.\"\n*   **Cultivated Area**: Table 1.1 shows the cultivated area in India, indicating a relatively stable trend over several decades:\n    *   1950–51: 129 million hectares\n    *   1990–91: 157 million hectares\n    *   2014–15 (P): 155 million hectares\n    This suggests that while the total cultivated area has increased slightly and then stabilized, the dramatic increase in food grain production must largely be attributed to improved yields through methods like the Green Revolution.\n\n### 3. The Concept of the Poverty Line\n\nThis section, also from \"Economics,\" delves into how poverty is measured and defined, specifically focusing on the \"poverty line\" concept in India.\n\n*   **Definition of Poverty Line**: It's a method used to measure poverty where a person is considered poor if their income or consumption level falls below a \"minimum level\" required to fulfill basic needs.\n*   **Variability**: The poverty line is not static; it varies by time, place, and country.\n    *   **Contextual**: What constitutes \"basic needs\" depends on a country's existing level of development and accepted social norms. For example, owning a car might signify poverty in the United States, but it's considered a luxury in India.\n*   **Determining the Poverty Line in India**:\n    *   **Criteria**: A minimum level of requirements is determined for essential items such as food, clothing, footwear, fuel and light, educational needs, and medical care.\n    *   **Calorie Requirement (Food)**: This is a crucial component.\n        *   **Rural Areas**: 2400 calories per person per day, considered higher due to more physical work.\n        *   **Urban Areas**: 2100 calories per person per day.\n    *   **Monetary Expenditure**: The physical quantities of these basic needs are multiplied by their prices in rupees. This monetary value is revised periodically to account for price inflation.\n    *   **Poverty Line Figures (2011–12)**:\n        *   **Rural Areas**: Rs 816 per person per month. A family of five would need Rs 4,080 per month.\n        *   **Urban Areas**: Rs 1000 per person per month. A family of five would need Rs 5,000 per month. The higher urban amount, despite lower calorie needs, is attributed to the generally higher prices of essential products in urban centers.\n*   **Estimation Process**: The poverty line is estimated periodically (typically every five years) through sample surveys conducted by the **National Sample Survey Organisation (NSSO)**.\n*   **International Comparisons**: For comparing poverty across developing countries, international organizations like the World Bank use a uniform standard. As of 2011, this standard was a minimum availability of the equivalent of **$1.90 per person per day** (using Purchasing Power Parity, ppp).\n*   **Poverty Estimates in India (Trends)**:\n    *   **Decline in Ratios**: There has been a significant reduction in poverty ratios. From approximately 45% in 1993-94, it fell to 37.2% in 2004–05, and further to about **22% in 2011–12**.\n    *   **Decline in Number of Poor**: The absolute number of poor people also decreased from 407 million in 2004–05 to 270 million in 2011–12, showing an average annual decline of 2.2 percentage points during that period.\n\nThis document provides a foundational understanding of progressive educational policies and critical economic concepts relevant to India.\n\n**Would you like me to:**\n• Elaborate on the specific recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005?\n• Provide more details about the impact and challenges of the Green Revolution in India?\n• Compare India's poverty line methodology with the international standards set by the World Bank?",

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number\nof teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the\n2020-21",

        "chunk_text": "Social exclusion can be\nPoverty Line\nAt the centre of the discussion on poverty\nis usually the concept of the “poverty line”.\nA common method used to measure\npoverty is based on the income or\n2020-21\n\n32  \n  Economics\nconsumption levels. A person is\nconsidered poor if his or her income or\nconsumption level falls below a given\n“minimum level” necessary to fulfill the\nbasic needs. What is necessary to satisfy\nthe basic needs is different at different\ntimes and in different countries.\nTherefore, poverty line may vary with time\nand place. Each country uses an\nimaginary line that is considered\nappropriate for its existing level of\ndevelopment and its accepted minimum\nsocial norms. For example, a person not\nhaving a car in the United States may be\nconsidered poor. In India, owning of a car\nis still considered a luxury.\nWhile determining the poverty line in\nIndia, a minimum level of food requirement,\nclothing, footwear, fuel and light,\neducational and medical requirement, etc.,\nare determined for subsistence. These\nphysical quantities are multiplied by their\nprices in rupees. The present formula for\nfood requirement while estimating the\npoverty line is based on the desired\ncalorie requirement. Food items, such as\ncereals, pulses, vegetable, milk, oil, sugar,\netc., together provide these needed\ncalories. The calorie needs vary depending\non age, sex and the type of work that a\nperson does. The accepted average calorie\nrequirement in India is 2400 calories per\nperson per day in rural areas and 2100\ncalories per person per day in urban\nareas. Since people living in rural areas\nengage themselves in more physical work,\ncalorie requirements in rural areas are\nconsidered to be higher than in urban\nareas. The monetary expenditure per\ncapita needed for buying these calorie\nrequirements in terms of food grains, etc.,\nis revised periodically taking into\nconsideration the rise in prices.\nOn the basis of these calculations, for\nthe year 2011–12, the poverty line for a\nperson was fixed at Rs 816 per month for\nrural areas and Rs 1000 for urban areas.\nDespite less calorie requirement,the\nhigher amount for urban areas has been\nfixed because of high prices of many\nessential products in urban centres. In\nthis way in the year 2011-12, a family of\nfive members living in rural areas and\nearning less than about Rs 4,080 per\nmonth will be below the poverty line. A\nsimilar family in the urban areas would\nneed a minimum of Rs 5,000 per month\nto meet their basic requirements. The\npoverty line is estimated periodically\n(normally every five years) by conducting\nsample surveys. These surveys are\ncarried out by the National Sample Survey\nOrganisation (NSSO). However, for\nmaking comparisons between developing\ncountries, \nmany \ninternational\norganisations like the World Bank use a\nuniform standard for the poverty line:\nminimum availability of the equivalent of\n$1.90 per person per day (2011, ppp).\n  Let’s Discuss\nDiscuss the following:\n•\nWhy do different countries use different\npoverty lines?\n•\nWhat do you think would be the\n“minimum necessary level” in your\nlocality?\nPoverty Estimates\nIt is clear from Table 3.1 that there is a\nsubstantial decline in poverty ratios in\nIndia from about 45 per cent in 1993-94\nto 37.2 per cent in 2004–05. The\nproportion of people below poverty line\nfurther came down to about 22 per cent\nin 2011–12. If the trend continues, people\nbelow poverty line may come down to less\nthan 20 per cent in the next few years.\nAlthough the percentage of people living\nunder poverty declined in the earlier two\ndecades (1973–1993), the number of poor\ndeclined from 407 million in 2004–05 to\n270 million in 2011–12 with an average\nannual decline of 2.2 percentage points\nduring 2004–05 to 2011–12.\n2020-21",

In case of Vilas, there\ncould not be any education or health care\nin the early part of his life. He spends\nhis life selling fish like his mother.\nHenceforth, he draws the same salary of\nunskilled labourer as his mother.\nInvestment in human resource (via\neducation and medical care) can give high\nrates of return in future. This investment\non people is the same as investment in\nland and capital.\nA child, too, with investments made\non her education and health, can yield\na high return in future in the form of\nhigher \nearnings \nand \ngreater\ncontribution to the society. Educated\nparents are found to invest more heavily\non the education of their child. This is\nbecause they have realised the\nimportance of education for themselves.\nThey are also conscious of proper\nnutrition and hygiene. They accordingly\nlook after their children’s needs for\neducation at school and good health. A\nvirtuous cycle is, thus, created in this\ncase. In contrast, a vicious cycle may\nbe created by disadvantaged parents,\nwho themselves uneducated and lacking\nin hygiene, keep their children in a\nsimilarly disadvantaged state.\nCountries, like Japan, have invested\nin human resource.

    "response": "Based on the document provided, there is **no information available** regarding \"unsupervised learning.\" The document focuses on topics related to:\n\n*   **Poverty as a Challenge:** Discussing its various dimensions (landlessness, unemployment, illiteracy, malnutrition, child labor, helplessness), social scientists' perspectives (income, consumption, social exclusion, vulnerability), and the concept of the poverty line (calorie requirements, monetary expenditure, and its estimation in India).\n*   **Educational Philosophy:** Referencing the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005, emphasizing linking school life to outside life, discouraging rote learning, promoting child-centered education, and encouraging creativity and hands-on experience.\n\nTo explain unsupervised learning, you would typically need a document covering topics in machine learning, artificial intelligence, or data science.\n\n**What is Unsupervised Learning (General Knowledge - Not from Document):**\n\nSince the document does not contain this information, here's a general explanation of what unsupervised learning is, to provide some context:\n\nUnsupervised learning is a category of machine learning algorithms that work with data that has not been labeled or categorized. Unlike supervised learning, where the model learns from input-output pairs (e.g., images labeled \"cat\" or \"dog\"), unsupervised learning algorithms are tasked with finding patterns, structures, or relationships within the data on their own, without any prior guidance.\n\n**Key characteristics and goals of unsupervised learning include:**\n\n*   **No Labeled Data:** The primary distinguishing factor is the absence of a \"target\" or \"output\" variable in the training data. The algorithm explores the input data directly.\n*   **Pattern Discovery:** Its main purpose is to discover hidden patterns, groupings, or features within the dataset.\n*   **Common Techniques:**\n    *   **Clustering:** This is perhaps the most common unsupervised learning task. It involves grouping data points such that items in the same group (cluster) are more similar to each other than to those in other groups. Examples include K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN.\n        *   **Example:** Grouping customer segments based on their purchasing behavior without prior knowledge of these segments.\n    *   **Dimensionality Reduction:** Techniques like Principal Component Analysis (PCA) or t-SNE reduce the number of random variables under consideration by obtaining a set of principal variables. This is useful for visualization and to simplify data for other algorithms.\n        *   **Example:** Reducing a dataset with hundreds of features to a few principal components to make it easier to visualize or process.\n    *   **Association Rule Mining:** This involves discovering interesting relationships or co-occurrences among a set of items.\n        *   **Example:** \"Market basket analysis\" – finding that customers who buy bread often also buy milk.\n*   **Applications:** Unsupervised learning is widely used in areas like anomaly detection (fraud detection), customer segmentation, recommendation systems, and data compression.\n\n**To understand unsupervised learning effectively, a document would typically need to cover:**\n\n*   The basics of machine learning paradigms.\n*   Specific algorithms like K-Means, PCA, etc.\n*   Examples of datasets and problems where unsupervised learning is applied.\n*   Comparisons with supervised and reinforcement learning.\n\n**Would you like me to:**\n• Provide a detailed explanation of the \"Poverty Line\" concept from the document?\n• Explain the role of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 as described in the document?\n• Create a visual representation of this data",

They show that\npoverty means hunger and lack of shelter.\nIt also is a situation in which parents are\nnot able to send their children to school\nor a situation where sick people cannot\nafford treatment. Poverty also means lack\nof clean water and sanitation facilities. It\nalso means lack of a regular job at a\nminimum decent level. Above all it means\nliving with a sense of helplessness. Poor\npeople are in a situation in which they\nare ill-treated at almost every place, in\nfarms, factories, government offices,\nhospitals, railway stations etc. Obviously,\nnobody would like to live in poverty.\nOne of the biggest challenges of\nindependent India has been to bring\nmillions of its people out of abject poverty.\nMahatama Gandhi always insisted that\nIndia would be truly independent only\nwhen the poorest of its people become free\nof human suffering.\nPoverty as seen by social scientists\nSince poverty has many facets, social\nscientists look at it through a variety of\nindicators. Usually the indicators used\nrelate to the levels of income and\nconsumption. But now poverty is looked\nthrough other social indicators like\nilliteracy level, lack of general resistance\ndue to malnutrition, lack of access to\nhealthcare, lack of job opportunities, lack\nof access to safe drinking water,\nsanitation etc. Analysis of poverty based\non social exclusion and vulnerability is\nnow becoming very common (see box).\nboth a cause as well as a\nconsequence of poverty in the usual\nsense. Broadly, it is a process through\nwhich individuals or groups are\nexcluded from facilities, benefits and\nopportunities that others (their\n“betters”) enjoy. A typical example is\nthe working of the caste system in\nIndia in which people belonging to\ncertain castes are excluded from\nequal opportunities. Social exclusion\nthus may lead to, but can cause more\ndamage than, having a very low\nincome.\nVulnerability\nVulnerability to poverty is a measure,\nwhich \ndescribes \nthe \ngreater\nprobability of certain communities\n(say, members of a backward caste)\nor individuals (such as a widow or a\nphysically handicapped person) of\nbecoming, or remaining, poor in the\ncoming years. Vulnerability is\ndetermined by the options available\nto different communities for finding\nan alternative living in terms of\nassets, education, health and job\nopportunities. Further, it is analysed\non the basis of the greater risks these\ngroups face at the time of natural\ndisasters (earthquakes, tsunami),\nterrorism etc. Additional analysis is\nmade of their social and economic\nability to handle these risks. In fact,\nvulnerability describes the greater\nprobability of being more adversely\naffected than other people when bad\ntime comes for everybody, whether a\nflood or an earthquake or simply a\nfall in the availability of jobs!\nSocial exclusion\nAccording to this concept, poverty\nmust be seen in terms of the poor\nhaving to live only in a poor\nsurrounding with other poor people,\nexcluded from enjoying social equality\nof better-off people in better\nsurroundings.

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number\nof teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the\n2020-21",

A person is\nconsidered poor if his or her income or\nconsumption level falls below a given\n“minimum level” necessary to fulfill the\nbasic needs. What is necessary to satisfy\nthe basic needs is different at different\ntimes and in different countries.\nTherefore, poverty line may vary with time\nand place. Each country uses an\nimaginary line that is considered\nappropriate for its existing level of\ndevelopment and its accepted minimum\nsocial norms. For example, a person not\nhaving a car in the United States may be\nconsidered poor. In India, owning of a car\nis still considered a luxury.\nWhile determining the poverty line in\nIndia, a minimum level of food requirement,\nclothing, footwear, fuel and light,\neducational and medical requirement, etc.,\nare determined for subsistence. These\nphysical quantities are multiplied by their\nprices in rupees. The present formula for\nfood requirement while estimating the\npoverty line is based on the desired\ncalorie requirement. Food items, such as\ncereals, pulses, vegetable, milk, oil, sugar,\netc., together provide these needed\ncalories. The calorie needs vary depending\non age, sex and the type of work that a\nperson does. The accepted average calorie\nrequirement in India is 2400 calories per\nperson per day in rural areas and 2100\ncalories per person per day in urban\nareas. Since people living in rural areas\nengage themselves in more physical work,\ncalorie requirements in rural areas are\nconsidered to be higher than in urban\nareas. The monetary expenditure per\ncapita needed for buying these calorie\nrequirements in terms of food grains, etc.,\nis revised periodically taking into\nconsideration the rise in prices.\nOn the basis of these calculations, for\nthe year 2011–12, the poverty line for a\nperson was fixed at Rs 816 per month for\nrural areas and Rs 1000 for urban areas.\nDespite less calorie requirement,the\nhigher amount for urban areas has been\nfixed because of high prices of many\nessential products in urban centres. In\nthis way in the year 2011-12, a family of\nfive members living in rural areas and\nearning less than about Rs 4,080 per\nmonth will be below the poverty line. A\nsimilar family in the urban areas would\nneed a minimum of Rs 5,000 per month\nto meet their basic requirements. The\npoverty line is estimated periodically\n(normally every five years) by conducting\nsample surveys. These surveys are\ncarried out by the National Sample Survey\nOrganisation (NSSO). However, for\nmaking comparisons between developing\ncountries, \nmany \ninternational\norganisations like the World Bank use a\nuniform standard for the poverty line:\nminimum availability of the equivalent of\n$1.90 per person per day (2011, ppp).\n  Let’s Discuss\nDiscuss the following:\n•\nWhy do different countries use different\npoverty lines?\n•\nWhat do you think would be the\n“minimum necessary level” in your\nlocality?\nPoverty Estimates\nIt is clear from Table 3.1 that there is a\nsubstantial decline in poverty ratios in\nIndia from about 45 per cent in 1993-94\nto 37.2 per cent in 2004–05. The\nproportion of people below poverty line\nfurther came down to about 22 per cent\nin 2011–12. If the trend continues, people\nbelow poverty line may come down to less\nthan 20 per cent in the next few years.\nAlthough the percentage of people living\nunder poverty declined in the earlier two\ndecades (1973–1993), the number of poor\ndeclined from 407 million in 2004–05 to\n270 million in 2011–12 with an average\nannual decline of 2.2 percentage points\nduring 2004–05 to 2011–12.\n2020-21",

This framework emphasizes connecting children's school life with their life outside school, moving away from rote learning, and fostering a child-centred education system.\n2.  **Economics - Agriculture (Modern Farming Methods and the Green Revolution):** The document then shifts to discussing agricultural practices. It details traditional and modern farming methods, the impact of the Green Revolution in India (introducing High Yielding Varieties or HYVs of seeds), and its effects on crop production, particularly wheat. It also touches upon the economic and environmental implications of these modern methods.\n\nI can help you explore specific details from these sections, such as:\n\n*   The key recommendations of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005.\n*   The characteristics and impact of the Green Revolution.\n*   The environmental concerns associated with modern farming techniques.\n*   Data on cultivated land area or crop production over different years.\n\nPlease let me know how I can help you further with this document.\n\n**Would you like me to:**\n• Explain the core principles of the National Curriculum Framework (NCF) 2005 in more detail?\n• Elaborate on the specifics of the Green Revolution and its impact on agriculture in India?\n• Create a visual representation of this data",

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number\nof teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book. We wish to thank the Chairperson of the\nadvisory group in Social Sciences, Professor Hari Vasudevan and the\n2020-21",

Why?\n  Suggested Activity\n•\nDuring your field visit talk to some\nfarmers of your region. Find out:\n1. What kind of farming methods —\nmodern or traditional or mixed — do\nthe farmers use? Write a note.\n2. What are the sources of irrigation?\n3. How much of the cultivated land is\nirrigated? (very little/nearly half/\nmajority/all)\n4. From where do farmers obtain the\ninputs that they require?\n3. Will the land sustain?\nLand being a natural resource, it is\nnecessary to be careful in its use.\nScientific reports indicate that the modern\nfarming methods have overused the\nnatural resource base.\nIn many areas, Green Revolution is\nassociated with the loss of soil fertility\ndue to increased use of chemical\nfertilisers. Also, continuous use of\ngroundwater for tubewell irrigation has\nled to the depletion of the water-table.\nEnvironmental resources, like soil fertility\nand groundwater, are built up over years.\nOnce destroyed it is very difficult to\nrestore them. We must take care of the\nenvironment \nto \nensure \nfuture\ndevelopment of agriculture.\n  Suggested Activity\n•\nAfter reading the following reports from\nnewspapers/magazines, write a letter\nto the Agriculture Minister in your own\nwords telling him how the use of\nchemical fertilisers can be harmful.\nProduction\nProduction\nof Pulses\nof Wheat\n1965 - 66\n10\n10\n1970 - 71\n12\n24\n1980 - 81\n11\n36\n1990 - 91\n14\n55\n2000 - 01\n11\n70\n2010 - 11\n18\n87\n2012 - 13\n18\n94\n2013 - 14\n19\n96\n2014 - 15\n17\n87\n2015 - 16\n17\n94\n2016 - 17\n23\n99\n2017 - 18\n24\n97\nTable 1.2: Production of pulses and wheat\n( in Million Tonnes)\n...Chemical \nfertilisers \nprovide\nminerals which dissolve in water and\nare immediately available to plants.\nBut these may not be retained in the\npesticides to produce best results. Higher\nyields were possible only from a\ncombination of HYV seeds, irrigation,\nchemical fertilisers, pesticides, etc.\nFarmers of Punjab, Haryana and\nWestern Uttar Pradesh were the first to\ntry out the modern farming method in\nIndia. The farmers in these regions set\nup tubewells for irrigation, and made use\nof HYV seeds, chemical fertilisers and\npesticides in farming. Some of them\nbought farm machinery, like tractors and\nthreshers, which made ploughing and\nharvesting faster. They were rewarded\nwith high yields of wheat.\nIn Palampur, the yield of wheat grown\nfrom the traditional varieties was 1300 kg\nper hectare. With HYV seeds, the yield\nwent up to 3200 kg per hectare. There\nwas a large increase in the production of\nwheat. Farmers now had greater amounts\nof surplus wheat to sell in the markets.\n  Let’s Discuss\n•\nWhat is the difference between multiple\ncropping and modern farming method?\n•\nThe following table shows the\nproduction of wheat and pulses in India\nafter the Green Revolution in units of\nmillion tonnes. Plot this on a graph.\nWas the Green Revolution equally\nsuccessful for both the crops? Discuss.\n•\nWhat is the working capital required\nby the farmer using modern farming\nmethods?\nSource: Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and\nFarmers Welfare, as on February , 2018.\n2020-21",

After discussing this\nmulti-dimensional problem through\nexamples, the chapter discusses the way\npoverty is seen in social sciences. Poverty\ntrends in India and the world are\nillustrated through the concept of the\npoverty line. Causes of poverty as well as\nanti-poverty measures taken by the\ngovernment are also discussed. The\nchapter ends with broadening the official\nconcept of poverty into human poverty.\nIntroduction\nIn our daily life, we come across many\npeople who we think are poor. They could\nbe landless labourers in villages or people\nliving in overcrowded jhuggis in cities. They\ncould be daily wage workers at\nconstruction sites or child workers in\nPoverty as a Challenge\nChapter\ndhabas. They could also be beggars with\nchildren in tatters. We see poverty all\naround us. In fact, every fourth person in\nIndia is poor. This means, roughly 270\nmillion (or 27 crore) people in India live\nin poverty 2011-12. This also means that\nIndia has the largest single concentration\nof the poor in the world. This illustrates\nthe seriousness of the challenge.\nTwo Typical Cases of Poverty\nUrban Case\nThirty-three year old Ram Saran works\nas a daily-wage labourer in a wheat\nflour mill near Ranchi in Jharkhand.\nHe manages to earn around Rs 1,500\na month when he finds employment,\nwhich is not often. The money is not\nenough to sustain his family of six—\nthat includes his wife and four children\naged between 12 years to six months.\nPoverty as a Challenge\n3\nPicture 3.1  Story  of Ram Saran\n2020-21",

The syllabi and textbooks developed on\nthe basis of NCF signify an attempt to implement this basic idea. They\nalso attempt to discourage rote learning and the maintenance of sharp\nboundaries between different subject areas. We hope these measures\nwill take us significantly further in the direction of a child-centred\nsystem of education outlined in the National Policy on Education (1986).\nThe success of this effort depends on the steps that school principals\nand teachers will take to encourage children to reflect on their own\nlearning and to pursue imaginative activities and questions. We must\nrecognise that given space, time and freedom, children generate new\nknowledge by engaging with the information passed on to them by adults.\nTreating the prescribed textbook as the sole basis of examination is one\nof the key reasons why other resources and sites of learning are ignored.\nInculcating creativity and initiative is possible if we perceive and treat\nchildren as participants in learning, not as receivers of a fixed body of\nknowledge.\nThese aims imply considerable change in school routines and mode\nof functioning. Flexibility in the daily time-table is as necessary as\nrigour in implementing the annual calendar so that the required number\nof teaching days are actually devoted to teaching. The methods used for\nteaching and evaluation will also determine how effective this textbook\nproves for making children’s life at school a happy experience, rather\nthan a source of stress or boredom. Syllabus designers have tried to\naddress the problem of curricular burden by restructuring and\nreorienting knowledge at different stages with greater consideration for\nchild psychology and the time available for teaching. The textbook\nattempts to enhance this endeavour by giving higher priority and space\nto opportunities for contemplation and wondering, discussion in small\ngroups, and activities requiring hands-on experience.\nThe National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT)\nappreciates the hard work done by the textbook development committee\nresponsible for this book.

In case of Vilas, there\ncould not be any education or health care\nin the early part of his life. He spends\nhis life selling fish like his mother.\nHenceforth, he draws the same salary of\nunskilled labourer as his mother.\nInvestment in human resource (via\neducation and medical care) can give high\nrates of return in future. This investment\non people is the same as investment in\nland and capital.\nA child, too, with investments made\non her education and health, can yield\na high return in future in the form of\nhigher \nearnings \nand \ngreater\ncontribution to the society. Educated\nparents are found to invest more heavily\non the education of their child. This is\nbecause they have realised the\nimportance of education for themselves.\nThey are also conscious of proper\nnutrition and hygiene. They accordingly\nlook after their children’s needs for\neducation at school and good health. A\nvirtuous cycle is, thus, created in this\ncase. In contrast, a vicious cycle may\nbe created by disadvantaged parents,\nwho themselves uneducated and lacking\nin hygiene, keep their children in a\nsimilarly disadvantaged state.\nCountries, like Japan, have invested\nin human resource. They did not have any\nnatural resource. These countries are\ndeveloped/rich. They import the natural\nresource needed in their country. How did\nthey become rich/developed?

We saw that\nVilas sold fish and Sakal got a job in the\nfirm. The various activities have been\nclassified into three main sectors i.e.,\nprimary, secondary and tertiary. Primary\nsector includes agriculture, forestry,\nanimal husbandry, fishing, poultry\nfarming, \nmining \nand \nquarrying.\nManufacturing is included in the\nsecondary sector.

The\nactivities in this sector result in the\nproduction of goods and services. These\nactivities add value to the national\nincome. These activities are called\neconomic activities. Economic activities\nhave two parts — market activities and\nnon-market activities. Market activities\ninvolve remuneration to anyone who\nperforms i.e., activity performed for pay\nor profit. These include production of goods\nor services, including government service.\nNon-market activities are the production\nfor self-consumption.

After discussing this\nmulti-dimensional problem through\nexamples, the chapter discusses the way\npoverty is seen in social sciences. Poverty\ntrends in India and the world are\nillustrated through the concept of the\npoverty line. Causes of poverty as well as\nanti-poverty measures taken by the\ngovernment are also discussed. The\nchapter ends with broadening the official\nconcept of poverty into human poverty.\nIntroduction\nIn our daily life, we come across many\npeople who we think are poor. They could\nbe landless labourers in villages or people\nliving in overcrowded jhuggis in cities. They\ncould be daily wage workers at\nconstruction sites or child workers in\nPoverty as a Challenge\nChapter\ndhabas. They could also be beggars with\nchildren in tatters. We see poverty all\naround us. In fact, every fourth person in\nIndia is poor. This means, roughly 270\nmillion (or 27 crore) people in India live\nin poverty 2011-12. This also means that\nIndia has the largest single concentration\nof the poor in the world. This illustrates\nthe seriousness of the challenge.\nTwo Typical Cases of Poverty\nUrban Case\nThirty-three year old Ram Saran works\nas a daily-wage labourer in a wheat\nflour mill near Ranchi in Jharkhand.\nHe manages to earn around Rs 1,500\na month when he finds employment,\nwhich is not often. The money is not\nenough to sustain his family of six—\nthat includes his wife and four children\naged between 12 years to six months.\nPoverty as a Challenge\n3\nPicture 3.1  Story  of Ram Saran\n2020-21",
